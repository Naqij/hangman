# UX

## User Goals
* User can type their name before starting the game.
* Gives enough lives to guess the word.
* Let the user know how many letters are in the word.

## User Inputs
* User can type their name before starting the game so it feels more personal.
* As a user I want to be asked to guess as random words as possible so I can challenge my self.
* As a user I would want to know the length of the word.
* As a user I want to know if I have already used the word that I have typed in.
