# UX

## User Goals
* User can type their name before starting the game.
* Gives enough lives to guess the word.
* Let the user know how many letters are in the word.

## User Inputs
* User can type their name before starting the game so it feels more personal.
* As a user I want to be asked to guess as random words as possible so I can challenge my self.
* As a user I would want to know the length of the word.
* As a user I want to know if I have already used the word that I have typed in.

## Owner Goals
* I have used online word library to choose random word so the user have more options in words.
* Increase the number of visiters.
* Increase rankings on search engines.

### Requirements
* Easy to navigate on various screen sizes.
* Keep the user interested with information to make them want to engage with the Hangman game.
* More words choice for user to guess.

### Expectations
* I expect screen size not to affect the quality of the Hangman game.
* I expect user is informed on every step that how many lives they are left with and what letters they have already guessed.

## Design Choices
* I have designed every step for hangman to be printed if wrong alphabet is typed.
* I have also designed a celebration hangman if user has guessed the word correctly.
